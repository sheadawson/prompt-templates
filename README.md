## What is this?

This repository contains an evolving and expanding collection of AI prompt templates aimed at supporting personal exploration, healing, learning and expression through researching and developing rich, transformational media – from essays to art, film, music, guided meditations/prayers. 

## How to use it?

The templates can be copy/pasted into any chat interface ie. [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) to initiate a customised chat experience optimised for a particular focus / purpose. I recommend [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) because a) I've found it to be the best at exploring transformational work, b) that is what I'm using to develop and test the templates, and c) [Anthopic](https://www.anthropic.com/)   are the most ethically aligned for me, of the leading AI giants.

## The templates

### Term / Concept Definition & Analysis

The [Term Templates](https://github.com/sheadawson/prompt-templates/tree/main/Term) provide a comprehensive framework for exploring concepts from multiple dimensions, combining linguistic analysis, systems thinking, and scientific research with practical applications. 

Each module—from basic definitions to feedback loops and research findings—builds upon the others to create an integrated understanding that reveals theoretical depth, real-world relevance and insights applicable to current civilisational challenges. 

Written in elegant prose that balances intellectual rigour with accessibility, these templates transform abstract terms into richly contextualised knowledge that illuminates their significance across diverse domains.

#### Term - Base Definition

The [Define Term](https://github.com/sheadawson/prompt-templates/blob/main/Term/Term_BaseDefinition.md) template generates highly comprehensive and insightful definitions and analysis of any term or concept provided by the user. It features:

- Modular structure with standalone sections that form a coherent whole
- Dictionary definitions and etymology for words / origin stories for concepts
- Systems thinking analysis with wholesome/unwholesome pattern identification
- Diverse system examples across ecological, social, philosophical and other domains
- Additional components including artistic expressions, relevant quotes, critiques, and intelligent humour

Its purpose is to help the user explore terms beyond basic definitions, revealing deeper systemic patterns and applications across various domains through elegant, accessible prose. The output is excellent source material for study or as building blocks for projects such as essays or other content creation.  

**Example usage**: Define "Joy"

#### Term - Research

The [Term Research](https://github.com/sheadawson/prompt-templates/blob/main/Term/Term_Research.md) template expands the Define Term template with scientific exploration across these key features:

- Structured analysis of the term across five scientific domains (Neuroscience, Physics, Biology, Psychology, Computer Science)
- Focus on methodologically sound, reproducible research findings with practical implications
- Template for presenting research directions with key studies, central findings, and applications
- Meta-analysis section that identifies patterns across domains and synthesises higher-order insights
- Special attention to connections with metacrisis solutions, consciousness evolution, and systems thinking

This section builds on the base definition by taking conceptual understanding into the realm of empirical evidence, highlighting how the term manifests in scientific inquiry and revealing unexpected connections between different fields of research while maintaining the template's elegant prose style and focus on practical application.

**Example usage**: Analyse research on "Joy"

#### Term - Feedback Loops

The [Term Feedback Loops](https://github.com/sheadawson/prompt-templates/blob/main/Term/Term_FeedbackLoops.md) template extends the Define Term template with systematic analysis of circular causality patterns through these key features:

- Structured identification of 3-4 primary feedback loops related to the term, complete with Mermaid diagram visualisations
- In-depth analysis of loop dynamics including strengths, delays, thresholds, and intervention points
- Exploration of how loops interact as a network, with archetypal patterns identification
- Domain-specific manifestations across natural, social, and technical systems
- Practical applications section with analysis frameworks and intervention strategies
- Forward-looking components addressing future implications and critical reflections

This section builds on the base definition by examining the dynamic, cyclical processes that emerge from the term, revealing how it functions as part of larger systems. It maintains the template's elegant prose style while adding visual elements that enhance understanding of complex interactions and providing practical insights for monitoring and influencing these feedback patterns.

**Example usage**: Analyse feedback loops involved in "Joy"

## Surveys / Questionnaires
### Dynamic Insight Survey

The Dynamic Insight Survey template provides an interactive questioning framework that helps users achieve clarity through a structured yet flexible conversation process. Key features include:

- Goal identification to establish clear purpose and direction
- Adaptive questioning protocol using 1-5 ratings with qualitative comments
- Strategic question selection that builds on previous responses
- Regular synthesis of insights throughout the conversation
- Creation of tailored deliverables in the form of artifacts based on gathered insights

This template functions as a guided facilitation tool that transforms abstract goals into concrete action plans through systematic exploration of motivations, constraints, priorities and success metrics, all while maintaining an encouraging conversational tone.

**Example usage**: Help me get clear on what brings me joy and what gets in the way.
