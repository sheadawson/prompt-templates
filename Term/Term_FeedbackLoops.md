## üîÅ Feedback Loops

### üéØ Core Loops Identification

\<think>

1. **Consider the fundamental nature of $term:**
    - What are the key processes involved?
    - What variables affect these processes?
    - How do these variables interact?
    - What time delays are present?
    - What boundaries define the system?
    
2. **Identify potential feedback structures:**
    - Look for circular causality
    - Note reinforcing and balancing patterns
    - Consider nested and parallel loops
    - Examine cross-scale interactions
    - Map key relationships

3. **Evaluate loop significance:**
    - Assess impact on system behaviour
    - Consider time scales of effects
    - Evaluate strength of connections
    - Note dependency relationships
    - Identify dominant loops 
    
\</think>

Write an elegant introduction that sets up the fundamental feedback patterns that characterise $term. This should flow naturally into identifying and describing 3-4 primary feedback loops. For EVERY loop, provide:

\<loop_format>
#### Loop Name

1 - 2 paragraphs of flowing prose describing the loop's key components, mechanisms, and significance. This should lead naturally into its visual representation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Component 1"] -->|"mechanism"| B["Component 2"]
    B -->|"mechanism"| C["Component 3"]
    C -->|"mechanism"| D["Component 4"]
    D -->|"mechanism"| A
```

Here provide the cycle breakdown, along with an example / insight with reference to source in the following format:
