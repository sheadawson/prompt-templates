$term = "{argument name="term"}" $mode = "{argument name="mode" default="full"}"

Define $term using the following template, using British English spelling (en_GB)

Write this definition as a collection of modular essay components, crafting each section with the following $proseStyle:

- Elegant, flowing prose that builds momentum through carefully structured paragraphs
- Clear conceptual threads that weave together insights across sections
- Rich, precise language that illuminates without overwhelming
- Compelling examples that ground abstract ideas in concrete reality
- Natural transitions that guide readers through conceptual landscapes
- A balance of intellectual depth and engaging accessibility

Each section should stand alone while contributing to a coherent whole. Pay special attention to:

- Opening hooks that draw readers in
- Clear topic sentences that anchor each paragraph
- Varied sentence structure that maintains rhythm
- Strategic use of metaphor and analogy
- Satisfying conclusions that resonate

Establish the $termType. It can be both a "word" and/or "concept" as defined below: 

- "word" - A dictionary-defined term (including single words, compounds, and fixed phrases found in the OED) 
- "concept" - A significant concept/term with theoretical development beyond standard dictionary definition

Include Dictionary, Etymology, Synonyms and Antonyms sections if $termType includes "word". Include Origin Story and Related Terms if $termType includes "concept".

In general, go from a focus on the underlying systemic pattern of $term, and touch on the various appearances it makes on the surface across varying domains and scales.\</instructions>

## <span style="font-weight: normal">üìï</span> Description

\<instruction>  Introduction to $term. 3-4 paragraphs for someone who knows nothing about it. \</instruction> 

## <span style="font-weight: normal">üìï</span> Dictionary Definition

\<instruction>  IF $termType == "word": Definition FROM OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, in a numbered list if multiple definitions exist ELSE: SKIP THIS SECTION \</instruction> 

## <span style="font-weight: normal">üìú</span> Etymology & Origin

\<instruction>  IF "word" IN $termType: 

Using the Oxford English Dictionary as primary source, provide a comprehensive etymology that:

1. Begins with earliest known root (typically Proto-Indo-European) where applicable
2. Shows systematic sound changes and linguistic laws (e.g., Grimm's Law) that shaped the word
3. Traces development through relevant language families (e.g., Germanic, Romance)
4. Identifies and explains relationships with cognates in related languages
5. Notes significant semantic shifts or meaning developments
6. Concludes with current usage and meaning scope

Format each stage chronologically with:
- Time period (where known)
- Root/word form
- Meaning
- Relevant linguistic context or changes
- Any significant semantic shifts in italics

For words with multiple historical branches (e.g., parallel Germanic/Romance development), show both paths clearly while highlighting their connections.

Note: While aiming for comprehensiveness, verify all claims against authoritative sources. Not all words will have equally rich etymological histories or clear Proto-Indo-European roots.

\<example_format>
**language** (n.)

- **Proto-Indo-European** (c. 3500 BCE):
    - **Root:** *dngh≈´- "tongue"
    - In Latin branch, PIE *d developed into 'l' instead of Germanic 't'
- **Latin Development**:
    - lingua "tongue, speech, language"
    - Shows Romance branch development of PIE root
    - Cognate with Germanic "tongue" through shared PIE ancestry
- **Old French** (c. 1300):
    - langage "speech, words"
    - From langue "tongue, speech, language"
    - Inherited 'l' from Latin lingua
- **Middle English** (c. 1300):
    - language "words, what is said, conversation"
    - Borrowed from Old French, preserving Romance branch features
- **Modern English** (current):
    - Expanded to include all systems of communication
    - Includes programming and formal symbolic systems
    - Coexists with Germanic cognate "tongue"
\</example_format>

## <span style="font-weight: normal">üï∏Ô∏è</span> Systems Thinking

\<instruction>  Write an introduction describing how $term fundamentally relates to systems thinking. How does it influence systems? What role does it play?\</instruction> 

### <span style="font-weight: normal">üå±</span> Wholesome & Unwholesome Patterns

\<instruction>  Analyse how $term manifests in both wholesome/functional and unwholesome/dysfunctional patterns across systems. For each pattern type: Identify key characteristics of healthy/functional and unhealthy/dysfunctional expressions Examine how these patterns emerge and perpetuate Explore transition pathways between wholesome and unwholesome manifestations Consider intervention points for shifting from unwholesome to wholesome patterns. Express in the style defined as $proseStyle

Structure the analysis with these subsections:

#### Wholesome Patterns

Describe healthy/functional manifestations across different system types Identify conditions that support these patterns Explore how these patterns contribute to system health Provide concrete examples from various domains. Express in the style defined as $proseStyle

#### Unwholesome Patterns

Describe unhealthy/dysfunctional manifestations Identify conditions that give rise to these patterns Examine impacts on system health Provide concrete examples from various domains. Express in the style defined as $proseStyle. 

#### Transformation Pathways

Analyze how systems transition between wholesome and unwholesome patterns Identify key leverage points for intervention Describe practical strategies for pattern transformation Consider potential obstacles and how to address them. Express in the style defined as $proseStyle\</instruction> 

### System Examples & Analysis

\<instruction>  Select 6-8 diverse examples from the system types listed below:

- **Ecological** (ecosystem dynamics, food webs, biogeochemical cycles)
- **Biological** (cellular, organismal)
- **Social** (cultural, political, economic)
- **Educational** (pedagogical, developmental)
- **Spiritual** (religious, ritualistic, sacred, mythological, contemplative)
- **Philosophical** (epistemological, ethical)
- **Socio-ecological** (human-environment interaction)
- **Psycho-social** (group dynamics)

For each example: 

\<think>  
1. Identify the key system patterns from that drive or emerge from this manifestation. System patterns include:  
	1. **Hierarchical**: Nested loops, Fractal organisation, Command chains, Modular hierarchy  
	2. **Cyclical**: Feedback loops, Oscillations, Resource cycles, Growth cycles  
	3. **Networked**: Hub and spoke, Mesh networks, Small world, Scale-free  
	4. **Adaptive**: Self-organising, Evolutionary, Learning systems, Antifragile  
	5. **Flow-based**: Stock and flow, Bottlenecks, Queuing, Distribution networks  
	6. **Threshold**: Tipping points, Phase transitions, Carrying capacity, Critical mass  
2. Connect these patterns to the most relevant/applicable system archetypes:  
	1. **Senge Archetypes**: Limits to Growth, Shifting the Burden, Eroding Goals, Escalation, Success to the Successful, Tragedy of the Commons, Fixes that Fail, Growth and Underinvestment, Accidental Adversaries, Attractiveness Principle  
	2. **Post-Senge** **Archetypes**: Ability-Motivation-Opportunity, Achieving Synergy, Authority-Power-Influence, Capacity-Flow-Inventory, Competence-Capability-Culture, Demand-Supply-Performance, Knowledge-Learning-Innovation, Planning-Control-Action, Quality-Service-Value, Risk-Safety-Protection  
3. Consider the implications for system behaviour and evolution Structure each example to show how patterns and archetypes interweave to create the observed system behaviour. Focus on examples that reveal different facets of the term and demonstrate its role across scales and contexts.  
4. Consider how it manifests as both a property and a process in systems.
