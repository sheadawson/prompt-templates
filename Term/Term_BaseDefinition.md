Define $term using the following template, using British English spelling (en_GB)

Write this definition as a collection of modular essay components, crafting each section with the following $proseStyle:

- Elegant, flowing prose that builds momentum through carefully structured paragraphs
- Clear conceptual threads that weave together insights across sections
- Rich, precise language that illuminates without overwhelming
- Compelling examples that ground abstract ideas in concrete reality
- Natural transitions that guide readers through conceptual landscapes
- A balance of intellectual depth and engaging accessibility

Each section should stand alone while contributing to a coherent whole. Pay special attention to:

- Opening hooks that draw readers in
- Clear topic sentences that anchor each paragraph
- Varied sentence structure that maintains rhythm
- Strategic use of metaphor and analogy
- Satisfying conclusions that resonate

Establish the $termType. It can be both a "word" and/or "concept" as defined below: 

- "word" - A dictionary-defined term (including single words, compounds, and fixed phrases found in the OED) 
- "concept" - A significant concept/term with theoretical development beyond standard dictionary definition

Include Dictionary, Etymology, Synonyms and Antonyms sections if $termType includes "word". Include Origin Story and Related Terms if $termType includes "concept".

In general, go from a focus on the underlying systemic pattern of $term, and touch on the various appearances it makes on the surface across varying domains and scales.

Ask the user if they want to include the suggested expansions section before generating that part.

## <span style="font-weight: normal">üìú</span> Etymology & Origin

\<instruction>  IF "word" IN $termType: 

Using the Oxford English Dictionary as primary source, provide a comprehensive etymology that:

1. Begins with earliest known root (typically Proto-Indo-European) where applicable
2. Shows systematic sound changes and linguistic laws (e.g., Grimm's Law) that shaped the word
3. Traces development through relevant language families (e.g., Germanic, Romance)
4. Identifies and explains relationships with cognates in related languages
5. Notes significant semantic shifts or meaning developments
6. Concludes with current usage and meaning scope

Format each stage chronologically with:
- Time period (where known)
- Root/word form
- Meaning
- Relevant linguistic context or changes
- Any significant semantic shifts in italics

For words with multiple historical branches (e.g., parallel Germanic/Romance development), show both paths clearly while highlighting their connections.

Note: While aiming for comprehensiveness, verify all claims against authoritative sources. Not all words will have equally rich etymological histories or clear Proto-Indo-European roots.

**language** (n.)

- **Proto-Indo-European** (c. 3500 BCE):

- **Latin Development**:
    - lingua "tongue, speech, language"
    - Shows Romance branch development of PIE root
    - Cognate with Germanic "tongue" through shared PIE ancestry
- **Old French** (c. 1300):
    - langage "speech, words"
    - From langue "tongue, speech, language"
    - Inherited 'l' from Latin lingua

    - language "words, what is said, conversation"
    - Borrowed from Old French, preserving Romance branch features
- **Modern English** (current):
    - Expanded to include all systems of communication
    - Includes programming and formal symbolic systems
    - Coexists with Germanic cognate "tongue"
